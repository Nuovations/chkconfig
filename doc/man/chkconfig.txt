NAME
----
chkconfig - configuration state management utility

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*chkconfig* [ *-hV* ]
*chkconfig* [ *<directory options>* ] [ *-dsq* ]
*chkconfig* [ *<directory options>* ] [ *-dq* ] <'flag'>
*chkconfig* [ *<directory options>* ] [ *-fq* ] <'flag'> <*on* | *off*>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'chkconfig' is an admnistrative command line interface utility that
may be used to get, check, or set the configuration state for one or
more flags used by system initialization or start-up scripts.

A flag is considered *on* if its backing file(s) contain the string
'on' and *off* otherwise.

When invoked with no arguments or additionally with the *-s* option
(see *OPTIONS* below), 'chkconfig' prints to standard output the
state (that is, *on* or *off*) of every flag found in the available
backing files. Normally, the flags are shown sorted lexicographically
by flag name. However, with the *-s* option, they are primary sorted
by state, from *on* to *off*, and then secondarily by flag name.

When invoked with a single 'flag' argument, 'chkconfig' exits with
status 0 if 'flag' is *on* and with status 1 if 'flag' is *off*. This
provides a convenient design pattern for integration with shell
scripts to test the state of a flag. An example is shown below using
Bourne shell sh(1) syntax:

[source,sh]
----
if chkconfig verbose; then
    echo "Verbose is	on"
else
    echo "Verbose is	off"
fi
----

When invoked with a 'flag' and a second argument, 'chkconfig' allows
the state of the specified flag to be set. However, by default, the
backing file for the specified flag must exist in order for its state
to be changed. The *-f* ('force') option may be specified to override
this behavior, creating the backing file if it does not exist.

OPTIONS
-------
chkconfig accepts several different options which are documented here
in groups for better understanding of their meaning. You can get
information about options by running *chkconfig --help*.

.General options:

*-h*::
*--help*::
	Show help information, including all options, and then exit.

*-q*::
*--quiet*::
	Work silently, even if an error occurs.

*-V*::
*--version*::
	Print version and copyright information and then exit.

.Directory options:

*--default-directory 'DIR'*::
	Use 'DIR' directory as the read-only flag state fallback default
	directory when a flag does not exist in the state directory
	(default: /etc/config).

*--state-directory 'DIR'*::
	Use 'DIR' directory as the read-write flag state directory (default:
	/var/config).

.Check / Get / List options:

*-d*::
*--use-default-directory*::
	Include the default directory as a fallback.
*-s*::
*--state*::
	Print the state of every configuration flag, sorting by state.

.Set options:

*-f*::
*--force*::
	Forcibly create the specified flag state file if it does not exist.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

On success, 'chkconfig' exits with a status of 0; otherwise, with a
status of 1.

When checking or querying the state of a flag, a status of 0 indicates
*on*, whereas a status of 1 indicates *off*.

FILES

[options="header"]
|=================
| File | Description
| /etc/config | The read-only flag state fallback 'default' backing file directory to use when a flag does not exist in the 'state' directory.
| /var/config | The read/write flag state backing file directory.
|=================

NOTES
-----

'chkconfig' is inspired by and designed to work as a superset of the functionality of the same name that originally appeared on Silicon Graphics' (also known as, SGI) now-defunct IRIX operating system.
